Tune the hyperparameters of the model to improve the performance. Consider the effect of each hyperparameter and adjust accordingly. Use the output to ensure that the hyperparameters make sense given the hardware and compute constraints. Make sure the output is a valid Jupyter notebook code without markdown or code block formatting.

ARC-AGI tasks are a series of three to five input and output tasks followed by a final task with only the input listed. Each task tests the utilization of a specific learned skill based on a minimal number of cognitive priors.
Tasks are represented as JSON lists of integers. These JSON objects can also be represented visually as a grid of colors using an ARC-AGI task viewer. A successful submission is a pixel-perfect description (color and position) of the final task's output.

As mentioned above, tasks are stored in JSON format. Each JSON file consists of two key-value pairs.
train: a list of two to ten input/output pairs (typically three.) These are used for your algorithm to infer a rule.
test: a list of one to three input/output pairs (typically one.) Your model should apply the inferred rule from the train set and construct an output solution. You will have access to the output test solution on the public data. The output solution on the private evaluation set will not be revealed.
Here is an example of a simple ARC-AGI task that has three training pairs along with a single test pair. Each pair is shown as a 2x2 grid. There are four colors represented by the integers 1, 4, 6, and 8. Which actual color (red/green/blue/black) is applied to each integer is arbitrary and up to you.
```
{
  "train": [
    {"input": [[1, 0], [0, 0]], "output": [[1, 1], [1, 1]]},
    {"input": [[0, 0], [4, 0]], "output": [[4, 4], [4, 4]]},
    {"input": [[0, 0], [6, 0]], "output": [[6, 6], [6, 6]]}
  ],
  "test": [
    {"input": [[0, 0], [0, 8]], "output": [[8, 8], [8, 8]]}
  ]
}
```

Evaluation
This competition evaluates submissions on the percentage of correct predictions. For each task, you should predict exactly 2 outputs for every test input grid contained in the task. (Tasks can have more than one test input that needs a predicted output.) Each task test output has one ground truth. For a given task output, any of the 2 predicted outputs matches the ground truth exactly, you score 1 for that task test output, otherwise 0. The final score is the sum averaged of the highest score per task output divided by the total number of task test outputs.

Submission File
The submission file for this competition must be a json named submission.json.

For each task output in the evaluation set, you should make exactly 2 predictions (attempt_1, attempt_2). The structure of predictions is shown below. Most tasks only have a single output (a single dictionary enclosed in a list), although some tasks have multiple outputs that must be predicted. These should contain two dictionaries of predictions enclosed in a list, as is shown by the example below. When a task has multiple test outputs that need to be predicted (e.g., task 12997ef3 below), they must be in the same order as the corresponding test inputs.

IMPORTANT: All the task_ids in the input challenges json file must also be present in the submission.json file. Both "attempt_1" and "attempt_2" must be present, even if your submission doesn't have 2 predictions.

{"00576224": [{"attempt_1": [[0, 0], [0, 0]], "attempt_2": [[0, 0], [0, 0]]}],
 "009d5c81": [{"attempt_1": [[0, 0], [0, 0]], "attempt_2": [[0, 0], [0, 0]]}],
 "12997ef3": [{"attempt_1": [[0, 0], [0, 0]], "attempt_2": [[0, 0], [0, 0]]},
              {"attempt_1": [[0, 0], [0, 0]], "attempt_2": [[0, 0], [0, 0]]}],
 ...
}

The objective of this competition is to create an algorithm that is capable of solving abstract reasoning tasks. Critically, these are novel tasks: tasks that the algorithm has never seen before. Hence, simply memorizing a set of reasoning templates will not suffice.

The format is different from the previous competition, so please read this information carefully, and refer to supplementary documentation as needed.

When looking at a task, a "test-taker" has access to inputs and outputs of the demonstration pairs (train pairs), plus the input(s) of the test pair(s). The goal is to construct the output grid(s) corresponding to the test input grid(s), using 2 trials for each test input. "Constructing the output grid" involves picking the height and width of the output grid, then filling each cell in the grid with a symbol (integer between 0 and 9, which are visualized as colors). Only exact solutions (all cells match the expected answer) can be said to be correct.

Any additional information, as well as an interactive app to explore the objective of this competition is found at the ARCPrize.org. It is highly recommended that you explore the interactive app, as the best way to understand the objective of the competition.

Task files
The information is stored in two files:

arc-agi_training-challenges.json: contains input/output pairs that demonstrate reasoning pattern to be applied to the "test" input for each task. This file and the corresponding solutions file can be used as training for your models.
arc-agi_training-solutions.json: contains the corresponding task "test" outputs (ground truth).
arc-agi_evaluation-challenges.json: contains input/output pairs that demonstrate reasoning pattern to be applied to the "test" input for each task. This file and the corresponding solutions file can be used as validation data for your models.
arc-agi_evaluation-solutions.json: contains the corresponding task "test" outputs (ground truth).
arc-agi_test-challenges.json: this file contains the tasks that will be used for the leaderboard evaluation, and contains "train" input/output pairs as well as the "test" input for each task. Your task is to predict the "test" output. Note: The file shown on this page is a placeholder using tasks from arc-agi_evaluation-challenges.json. When you submit your notebook to be rerun, this file is swapped with the actual test challenges.
sample_submission.json: a submission file in the correct format
Each task contains a dictionary with two fields:

"train": demonstration input/output pairs. It is a list of "pairs" (typically 3 pairs).
"test": test input - your model should predict the output.
A "pair" is a dictionary with two fields:

"input": the input "grid" for the pair.
"output": the output "grid" for the pair.
A "grid" is a rectangular matrix (list of lists) of integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive). The smallest possible grid size is 1x1 and the largest is 30x30.

When notebooks are submitted for rerun, they are scored using 100 unseen tasks found in the rerun file named arc-agi_test_challenges.json. The rerun tasks will contain train pairs of inputs and outputs as well as the tasks test input. Your algorithm must predict the test output. The majority of the 100 tasks used for leaderboard score only have one test input that will require a corresponding output prediction, although for a small number of tasks, you will be asked to make predictions for two test inputs.
